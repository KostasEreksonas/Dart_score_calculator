# Dart score calculator program

This is a simple CLI program used to calculate sets, legs and points of darts game. It is written to count score of a two player game. This program is createad with Python programming language. The code can be found within [Dart_score_calculator.py](Dart_score_calculator.py) file and is distributed under a GNU GPL-3.0 License.

I've also started creating a [GUI version](Dart_score_calculator_GUI.py) of this dart score calculator.

# CLI version

Features of this version are:

1. Count score for a 2 player game.
2. Choose, how many sets and legs you want to play in your game.
3. Set a point count for a leg.
4. Count an average score of 3-dart throws made.
5. Count stats - ammount of times of scored 100's 140's and 180's.

# GUI version

Features of this version are:

1 A comprehensible GUI for counting stats of a darts game.

A sketch of how a finished GUI would look like is presented below:

Also I have added a [.drawio file for calculator's GUI scheme](/scheme/score_calculator_GUI_sketch.drawio) in a [scheme](/scheme/) folder

# Further work
Later I plan to create a GUI version of this dart score calculator using also Python.
